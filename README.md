This is a Bayesian variable selection method that models the relationship between the activity of cis-regulatory elements and target gene expression using the genomic features within the CREs as priors in determining whether they should be included.

See [this page](https://gradonion.github.io/BVS_cre-gene/) for details about the bvs model and the comparison in performance between bvs and elastic net.
